**Description:**  
Vanilla Grid is a minimalist JavaScript library designed for rendering and managing tabular data in web applications. Unlike traditional grid libraries that rely on frameworks like jQuery or large JavaScript ecosystems, Vanilla Grid is completely dependency-free. Its small footprint ensures rapid loading times and makes it particularly suited for projects where performance and simplicity are paramount.

**Getting Started:**  

```
git clone https://github.com/skriptxadmin/vanilla-grid-demos.git

npm i

npm i @skriptx2/vanillagrid

npm start

```
You can view the output in localhost:1234 or port shown on the command prompt
